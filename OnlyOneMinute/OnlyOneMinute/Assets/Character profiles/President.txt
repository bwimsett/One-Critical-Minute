Name: Mister President
Age: 72 (Born 1918)

Mister is the embodiment of the American Dream. At least that's what he believes. Born into a wealthy family, he was used to money from a young age, before throwing it all out the window in 1955. Literally. A helicopter window.
He was disowned by all but his dog - Herbert, and found himself working his way through corporate ranks until he finally landed the top job.
He moved into the White House in 1990, with First Lady Petunia President, son Peter President, and dog Greg.
