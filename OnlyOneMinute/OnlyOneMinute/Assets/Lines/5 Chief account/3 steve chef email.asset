  preview: 'Subject: I resign\nSender: stevechef@whitehouse.gov\n\nChief,\nThe late
    night second-dinner calls for the president have become a joke. If it were simply
    an omelette or a salad I would not be handing in my resignation. But instead I
    am insulted, as a chef, being sent to fetch KFC at 2am every morning. Consider
    this my resignation.\nAdios.'
